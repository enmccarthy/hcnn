# neuralNet
In its current state, it is a two layer neural network that uses log activation and cross entropy loss

The backpropagation needs to be extended to include more layers, should be simple.

Further work needs to be put into testing as well. 

I think after my first attempt at this, I would probably start over in order to 
create a more readable/efficient/robust implementation.

For the current data set, and two layer neural net my accuracy is 84%
